# methodOkta Documentation

Hello and welcome to the methodokta documentation. While we always want to provide the most comprehensive documentation possible, we thought you may find the below sections a helpful place to get started.

- The [Getting Started](./getting-started/basic-usage.md) section provides onboarding material
- The [Development](./development/setup.md) header is the best place to get started on developing on top of and with methodokta
- See the [Docs](./index.md) section for a comprehensive rundown of methodokta capabilities
